# Saga - A Proof of Concept

This is a proof-of-concept for the Saga application. A CLI based web-service that allows you to learn a random topic by recommending a random piece of documentation to you given a topic.

Currently, I have the following documentation domains available
* docker 
* kubernetes
* healthnavigator
* aws-knowledge-center

Upon selection, the app will recommend a random piece of documentation from the domain and you will be able to answer Y or N if you would like to read it in full.

Once again, please note that this is merely a proof of concept and is not intended as anything close to the final working version of the app.

## Terminology, Concepts, Architecture

The working version of the app is made up of two services and two main sources of data

### Services
* Sitemap Generator - 
* Sitemap Updater - 
* Recommender - 

### Datasources

#### Sitemaps by domain

Generated by the 

#### All sites list

But do we put the topic in the site object? We can move forward with the following options

##### Option 1: Associate the topic with the url object

This requires an additional step by the sitemaps by domain function

```json
{
    "url":"",
    "domain":"",
    "topic": "",
    "reads":"",
    "recommends": ""
}
```

##### Option 2: Do not associate the topic with the url object and just let the following code block handle the search

```python
def remove_invalid_links(links, domain):
  valid_links = []
  #Logic evaluates the path and whether the path ends with /
  #
  # Evaluation for which links are valid could improve
  #

  for link in links:
    if domain in link['url'] and link['url'][-1] == '/':
      valid_links.append(link)
  
  return valid_links
```

Results in higher memory usage, but requires more logic in generating the sitemap

Format

```json
{
    "url":"",
    "domain":"",
    "reads":"",
    "recommends": ""
}
```

Assuming we go forward with option 1, this is a mongodb data source 

#### Knowledge repo

Lists the topics, domains to search, and the URL paths that pertain to that topic

```
topic,domain+url,category
kubernetes,https://kubernetes.io/docs,technology
```


## Ideas

* Get a way for people to store custom topics
